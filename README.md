# Puzzle
 
This thing took up so many hours of my life but it ended up running dry.
I ran out of interest with this project after no matter what I did the 
graphics would not comply. The original concept was to have a puzzle, 
yea that's it. I tried a lot of different ideas and a lot of different
concepts and spent the better part of 2 weeks struggling with this project,
but I didnt make it any further than the pieces being made, and even those
didn't really turn out how they should have. This is probably one of my 
biggest defeats when it comes to coding projects, but to be honest, only
one out of every four things I start results in a finished product. I 
hate this project with a burning passion
